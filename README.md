# Effectively Remove the Bicycle from 7 Days to Die
Hate the Bicycle? Now you don't have to see it anymore.

## Changes
1. prevent Bicycle or Bicycle Chassis from appearing in loot or trader inventory
1. prevent Bicycle Chassis Schemaitc from appearing in loot or trader inventory
1. remove Bicycle Chassis as a learnable recipe from the Grease Monkey skill
    - adjust the English description for `Grease Monkey Rank 1` to reflect changes

## Notes
- Bicycle Handlebars (and schematics) are left in-tact since they are still necessary for crafting the Augor and Chainsaw tools
- Admins can still spawn, use, and/or give Bicycles to players
- Did not update non-English descriptions for `Grease Monkey Rank 1` since I don't have a high level of confidence in my understanding of other languages and didn't want to butcher them
