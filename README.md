# Effectively Remove the Bicycle from 7 Days to Die
Hate the Bicycle? Now you don't have to see it anymore.

## Changes
- prevent Bicycle or Bicycle Chassis from appearing in loot or trader inventory
- prevent Bicycle Chassis Schemaitc from appearing in loot or trader inventory
- remove Bicycle Chassis as a learnable recipe from the Grease Monkey skill

## Notes
- Bicycle Handlebars (and schematics) are left in-tact since they are still necessary for crafting the Augor and Chainsaw tools
- Admins can still spawn, use, and/or give Bicycles to players
